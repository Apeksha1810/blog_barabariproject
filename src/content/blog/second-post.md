## Language Codes

Languages are identified by their [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code. The following table lists the languages supported by the site. Any language which we use but is not assigned a code is assigned the code `und` (for "undefined") OR

If we chose to define a code for it, it is assigned the code `bbr-<first 2 lexical non clashing letters>` ex: `bbr-bh` for Bhili (3M speakers) is allowed diespite the fact that `bh` is already taken (now deprecated) by Bihari. This is going to be very unlikely but in any case we have to be prepared for it.

Language weights are determined by the number of speakers. The following also includes the number of [Indian speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India) (as of 2011)

| Language | Standard Code | Internal Code | # Speakers |
